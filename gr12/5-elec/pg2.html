		<p> In this section we will be investigating the idea of <em>charge.</em> The concept of charge can seem pretty abstract at first, but it becomes more clear when we see how charges interact with each other. </p>
		<p> Start by checking off "<em>Show no charges"</em> below the sweater to the left (we can't see charges in the real world!). </p>
		<p> If you move the balloon close to the sweater and the wall and release it, you should not notice anything unusual.</p>
		<p> Try it out and click <em>Next</em> when you are ready to move on.</p><br>
