			<p> In this section we will be investigating the idea of <em>charge.</em> The concept of charge can seem pretty abstract at first, but it becomes more clear when we see how charges interact with each other. </p>
			<p> Start by checking off "<em>Show no charges"</em> below the sweater in the simulation to the left (we want to observe the different interactions just as we would in the real world). </p>
			<p> If you move the balloon close to the sweater and the wall and release it, you should not notice anything unusual.</p>
			<p> Try it out and click <em>Next</em> when you are ready to move on.</p><br>
